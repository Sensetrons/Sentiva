# Sentiva: Protecting Media Privacy with AI

Sentiva is an innovative project designed to safeguard sensitive media files and prevent the misuse of deepfake content. By leveraging cutting-edge AI technology, Sentiva acts as a privacy-first layer on your device, ensuring that sensitive images and videos never leave your control without your consent.

## Key Features

- **Sensitive Media Detection**  
  Detects and flags explicit or private content, ensuring it stays private and secure.

- **Deepfake Protection**  
  Identifies and blocks the transmission of manipulated or deepfake media files.

- **On-Device Processing**  
  All AI operations are performed locally on your device, guaranteeing privacy and security.

- **User-Customizable Rules**  
  Users can personalize detection settings to suit their specific privacy needs.

- **Encrypted Personal Database**  
  A secure and encrypted database allows users to register media they wish to protect.

- **Real-Time Blocking**  
  Prevents sensitive media from being sent to ISPs or other devices without proper verification.

## How It Works

1. **Media Interception**  
   Sentiva intercepts outgoing media files and scans them for sensitive content using AI models.

2. **AI Scanning**  
   - **Explicit Content Detection**: Identifies nudity or explicit imagery.
   - **Deepfake Analysis**: Flags AI-generated or manipulated media.

3. **Blocking Mechanism**  
   If the media is identified as sensitive or manipulated, it is blocked from being transmitted.

4. **User Alerts**  
   The system notifies users when a sensitive file is flagged, providing options for further actions.

## Technologies Used

- **AI and Machine Learning**  
  - TensorFlow or PyTorch for building AI models.  
  - Pre-trained models for nudity detection (e.g., NudeNet).  
  - Deepfake detection using FaceForensics++ or similar datasets.

- **Edge AI**  
  - TensorFlow Lite for real-time on-device processing.

- **Security and Encryption**  
  - AES/RSA encryption for personal databases.  
  - Secure user authentication.

- **Middleware Development**  
  - Built with high-performance languages like Go or Rust.
